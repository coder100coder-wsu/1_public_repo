Have a relatively new smartphone (Android or iPhone, 2018 or later) and reasonable (say, 5Mbps) internet access?

Then you can participate in the testing our our new online yoga teaching tool. We always need extra students!

It's a short, 20-minute class, taught by one of our instructors. All yoga levels welcome, though the class itself is quite a basic one. It's not so much about the yoga as the new teaching experience, which is a bit like Zoom but much, much more.

If you'd like to do it, answer the questions here:
https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6301903/PYlive

You can do this from anywhere you have internet access and enough space for yoga!  (But you must reside in the US.)

We're a real, venture-backed company working on fitness technology. We've found that getting a ton of people through our newest products is the fastest way to finding and fixing problems, so thanks for the help.

See you soon.    "

Phone Room Representative at our Waltham, Ma location. 

A major market research facility is looking to hire call center representatives to work in our phone room. You would be contacting people by phone and asking them a series of questions to see if they qualify for paid market research studies. We are not in the business of selling anything and this is not a cold calling position - the people that you would be calling want to be contacted. This is not a job you can do from your residence. 

This position is based in our call center/phone room and we are looking for potential team members who are comfortable being on the phone, are outgoing, can multi-task, who work well in a team setting and who enjoy being on the phone. Phone and/or call center experience is a plus!

This position is a part time position with flexible schedules between 9am - 3pm, Monday - Friday. 20- 28 hours a week. 

If you are interested in applying for this position, please email your resume to ChristineL@boston.fieldwork.com as well as why you feel you would be a good fit for this position. 

We look forward to hearing from you!

*The process should not be painful and you should be able to go back to work/school the day after your retrieval
*You can live anywhere in the United States and be a donor

Calling all mothers out there! What if you could help give the most beautiful gift in the world to another family while financially helping your own?



Surrogacy is a rewarding experience for everyone involved. You don’t have to choose between surrogacy or a job. You can do surrogacy as a stay-at-home mom or as a second job, all while getting compensated for it. We admire your desire to give the most beautiful gift in the world to a family, while financially helping your own.






""In my quest to fulfill my dream of helping a family through surrogacy I researched several agencies in the California area. I found so many great reviews on Physician's Surrogacy. I called and the staff was quick to answer all my questions. They certainly helped put my mind at ease and was the first agency (I called several) tat I spoke with where I finally sensed ""this is where I belong.""


Your safety and happiness are our primary concern. A surrogacy journey is an emotional and complex medical process that can change lives and bring joy to all involved. Our team of physicians work diligently to ensure a safe and smooth journey. Take the first step by completing your application today to find out if you're eligible. Did you know you can earn up to $11,000 before you are even pregnant? 











Physician's Surrogacy is the leading surrogacy agency in San Diego, with the largest program in North America, providing comprehensive agency services for more than 20 years.
Our in-house physicians and caring surrogacy coordinators will be happy to guide you through our surrogacy process. Also, our in-house OB liaison can answer any medical questions you may have. Together, we have over 150+ combined years of clinical and professional experience.



Basic Criteria:


Ages 20-37 years old
Have had at least one child of your own
No major complications during pregnancy and/or delivery
Live a healthy lifestyle (no drugs, smoking and healthy body weight)
Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,  or Washington Resident















Our compensation package is hard to beat, but if you find a higher package, we will happily match it.
Second or third time surrogates will qualify for higher compensation. 
		As with most agencies, compensation is commensurate with experience, and experienced 
		surrogates will qualify for higher compensation. At Physician's Surrogacy, we believe 
		surrogates should be compensated for the time, commitment, and physical sacrifices 
		made during their journey.








The Ultimate Surrogacy Experience:


 With our monthly support groups, dedicated support teams, and lifetime opportunity, we provide a convenient, caring, and experienced environment for this beautiful journey. One of our experienced Surrogate Coordinators would love to speak with you and answer any questions you may have.
